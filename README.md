- Effectively incorporate embedding layers into neural networks using Keras
- Import and use pretrained word embeddings from popular pretrained models such as GloVe
- Understand and explain the concept of a mean word embedding, and how this can be used to vectorize text at the sentence, paragraph, or document level
